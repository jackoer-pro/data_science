🚀 Billionaire Data Analysis: Escaping the Matrix

As a child, I wondered why my parents struggled to buy an ice cream while others bought yachts without a second thought. That curiosity became a drive to understand the "secret" to extreme wealth.
I chose Computer Science to stop guessing and start analyzing. This project is my first deep dive into the data to find the truth.

📊 Key Insights
The Technology Glitch: While the median billionaire age is 64, Tech is the only sector that consistently "glitches," producing young, self-made outliers.

Scalability: Wealth in the Matrix isn't built on labor; it’s built on leverage. Code and software allow one person to scale an idea to billions.

Geography: Success is clustered. The US and China act as gravity wells for capital.

🏁 Final Word to Fellow Coders
The data shows an optimistic future for Technology. Stay consistent with your goal. Every tech giant once sat where we are—debugging errors and wondering if their code mattered. 
In this industry, the distance between a small script and a global disruption is shorter than anywhere else.

You don't yet know where your ideas will take you, but the data proves the next anomaly could be yours.
